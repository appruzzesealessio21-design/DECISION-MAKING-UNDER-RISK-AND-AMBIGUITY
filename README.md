# Behavioral Economics Project

## Overview
This project explores key concepts in **Behavioral Economics**, focusing on systematic deviations from the predictions of standard Expected Utility Theory (EUT). The objective is to combine **theoretical models** with **experimental evidence** in order to better understand how real individuals make decisions under risk and uncertainty.

The project was developed in an academic setting and integrates both established results from the literature and original experimental data collected during classroom experiments.

## Motivation
Traditional economic models assume fully rational agents who satisfy axioms such as **Independence** and **Betweenness**. However, a large body of experimental evidence shows persistent and systematic violations of these assumptions.

This project aims to:
- Analyze why these violations occur
- Evaluate whether they should be interpreted as irrational behavior or as evidence of misspecified models
- Compare Expected Utility models with alternative **Non‑EU frameworks**

---

## Theoretical Framework
The project is structured around a comparison between:

### Expected Utility Theory (EU)
- Independence axiom
- Betweenness axiom
- Linear probability weighting

### Non‑Expected Utility Models
- **Prospect Theory** and Rank‑Dependent Utility
- Probability weighting and reference dependence
- Ambiguity aversion models (e.g. MaxMin, Choquet Expected Utility)
- Models of imprecise preferences as an alternative to irrationality

Special attention is given to how these models relax or violate the Independence and Betweenness axioms.

---

## Experimental Design
Two experimental reports (Report I and Report II) are used as empirical foundations:

- Participants were asked to rank and choose between lotteries
- Choice sets were designed to test violations of Independence and Betweenness
- Both simple and compound lotteries were included

The experiments can be interpreted as small‑scale replications of classic behavioral results (e.g. Allais‑type paradoxes).

---

## Results
Key findings include:
- Clear and systematic violations of Independence and Betweenness
- Preference reversals across equivalent lotteries
- Patterns consistent with probability weighting and ambiguity aversion

The experimental outcomes align more closely with Non‑EU models than with standard Expected Utility Theory.

---

## Discussion
Rather than interpreting violations as pure irrationality, the results suggest that:
- Standard axioms may be too restrictive
- Alternative models provide a more realistic representation of decision‑making
- Observed behavior can often be rationalized once preferences are allowed to be non‑linear or imprecise

---

## Skills and Competencies Acquired
- Behavioral economics theory
- Experimental design and analysis
- Interpretation of choice data under risk and uncertainty
- Critical comparison of competing economic models
- Academic writing and formal economic argumentation

---

## Future Developments
Possible extensions of the project include:
- Larger experimental samples
- Online or incentivized experiments
- Integration with econometric estimation of preference parameters
- Application to policy‑relevant contexts (insurance, pensions, climate decisions)

---

## Conclusion
This project highlights the limits of standard rational choice theory and shows how Behavioral Economics provides powerful tools to better understand real‑world decision making under risk and uncertainty.
